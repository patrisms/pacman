# Description
This aminated project was created primarily in JavaScript as part of my coursework for the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development program. 

# Fun Fact 
I improvised and added my own spin on this project by using Adobe Photoshop to change the colors of two of the PacMan images to allow for an illusion of a flashing PacMan as it travels across the screen.

# Installation/Usage
There are no specific installation steps. Just download the files, and have a blast! Feel free to use and edit as you see fit!

# Support
Any questions? Email me at patricia.tibere@gmail.com.

# Roadmap
I hope to update this project down the line to incorporate more creative elements as my knowledge of JavaScript increases.
